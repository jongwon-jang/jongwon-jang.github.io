# Variables, Simple Data Types, and String Interpolation

## 4 Variable types in Swift that I learned
`String`, `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`

## How to make a multi-line string
```swift
`x3 Multi\
    Line\
    String
`x3
```

## String Interpolation
```swift
var score = 80
var str = "My test score is \(score)
```
## `let` vs `var`
`let` creates a constant. Variable created with a `let` keyword cannot be modified after its declaration.
For example,
```swift
let name = "Jongwon"
name = "Jang"
```
Xcode will refuse to run the code

## Type Inference and Type Annotation
```swift
let str = "hello"
```
This makes `str` a string. So later it cannot be reassigned to another type (e.g `Int`or a `Bool`)
This is called `Type Inference`

To be explicit about the type:
```swift
let day: Int = 16
let happy: Bool = true
let hello: String = "hello"
let pi: Double = 3.14
```
This way you are not relying on Swift's type inference
